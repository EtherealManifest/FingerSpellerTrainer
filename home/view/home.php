<p class = "details">Welcome to FingerSpeller Trainer! This is a lightweight, php-based program that I designed to imporve my Sign Language and Dexterity.
    THis app uses a MySQL Database to track various attributres about the way that you sign. for instance, your fastest and slowest times, the average amount
    of time you take to sign, the number of times you have signed that particular word. The point of all of this data is to allow you to improve yourself.
    From the get go, this app has no words or strings, only letters. As you learn new signs, you can take the time to add them in using the corresponding 
    buttons above. Of note is the terms "string". These are short words meant to be fingerspelled. THese can be words like "tub", "Park", or "bus" that are always fingerspelled,
    or you can add long words like "Jenova" to challenge your dexterity. Type these words in normally. when you quiz yourself, there will be spaces added to indicate that these
    words should be spelled. Letters are pre-loaded, after all there are only 26 of them. As you add letters and words, the usefulness of this app increases. On the test screen,
    you can select options to define what kind of quiz you wish to take. Note: Choosing "100 Most Common Letters" does not make more magically appear. There are still only 26. 
    The tests run until you click back to the home link, and the words you sign when you click the link is not recorded as data. I advise you to have fun, and learn and add the 
    words that you want to add. ASL is so much fun when you are learning the parts of it that you want to learn. </p> 

    <p>Thanks to Dr. Bill Vicars for his inspiration to start learning ASL!</p>
